# Contributing to matthewa313/styleguide

Thank you for taking the time to contribute!

## How Can I Contribute?

You can tell us one of four main things:
1. What languages are we missing a style guide for
2. What style guides might we be missing
3. Outdated style guide
3. A typo or formatting issue
4. Miscellaneous

Since this is merely a curated list, we would prefer that you contribute only by *creating issues* and let the project organizers edit the README.

### Creating Issues

Do you know of a cool style guide that is not listed here? If it is not also on the [open issues](https://github.com/matthewa313/styleguide/issues), please create a new issue and tell us about it.

Please sort your issues into one of four categories:
- `[L]` : Tell us the language we are missing
- `[G]` : Tell us a guide we are missing
- `[O]` : Tell us a style guide on our list that is outdated
- `[F]` : Tell us of a formatting issue
- `[M]` : Tell us something else not in one of the above categories

So some example issue titles might look like:
- `[L] Missing C++`
- `[L] Missing Python`
- `[G] Missing Google's Java Style Guide`
- `[O] Outdated Visual Basic Style Guide`
- `[F] Typo on line 3 of README`

Please also use the corresponding issue tags.

Inside of the issue, please:
* provide a direct link to a style guide (unless type `[F]`)
* include a brief, clear explanation of the suggestion

### Submitting Pull Requests

Please do not submit pull requests.

### Voting and commenting

You can use GitHub reactions and comments to express your feelings about suggestions.  Please do not use Github polls.

## Quality Metrics

We include style guides on our list if they are (1) the official style guide or (2) generally useful to the programming community.

### Many thanks to all of our [contributors](https://github.com/matthewa313/styleguide/graphs/contributors).
